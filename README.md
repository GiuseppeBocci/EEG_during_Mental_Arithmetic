# EEG_during_Mental_Arithmetic
This repository contains the project of **analysis on EEG during mental arithemetic** produced for the Biomedical Signal Processing module of the course BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MEDICAL IMAGES taught by prof. Signorini Maria Grazia and prof. Steyde Giulio at "Politecnico di Milano" A.Y. 2023/2024.
My group amimed to the ability of descern two state of the subject: a resting state and a task(mental arithemetic perdormed) state.
